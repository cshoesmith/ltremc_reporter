## Versioning Workflow

To increment the application version:
1.  Open `config.json` in the root directory.
2.  Update the `version` string (e.g., change `19.12 build23` to `19.12 build24`).
3.  Restart the application service or rebuild the container.
4.  The new version will automatically appear on the landing page below the file input card.
